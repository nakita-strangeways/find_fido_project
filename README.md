# find_fido_project
A website that allows a community to come together to find their lost pets. If a person sees a stray animal, they can take a photo and  submit a form of the animals description. The form will (using their location or a typed in address) put a pin on a map (using Google Maps API). Mousing over the pin will show the photo thumbnail.
 
 
 Coming Soon!
